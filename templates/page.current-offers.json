The real problem is only because the vast majority of anti-aging skin care products, available in many popular department stores, aren’t getting it right.<br\/><br\/>The problem starts at the base. Have you ever noticed how often you see ingredients like mineral oil (also known as paraffin and petrolatum) in skin care products? Mineral oil is ubiquitous as a base in anti-aging skin cream, even though it’s actually a by-product of petroleum – just like the oil you put in your car. It’s cheap to produce, and gives the appearance (at least at first) of working: It makes your skin shiny, and seals in moisture. It also seals your pores, which causes inflammation, and eventually, collagen damage.<br\/><br\/>As a strict matter of policy, and a promise to our many loyal customers, Chamonix® never uses mineral oil, petroleum by-products or pharmaceutical preservatives in our anti-aging skin care products. And, we never test on animals. Our luxurious antioxidant skin care formulations contain only pure ingredients in a proprietary base of calendula extract.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style":"primary","align_text":"left","image_width":"50","layout":"right","divider":false,"top_padding":true,"bottom_padding":true,"lazyload_images":true}},"92660659-67c1-4df3-91de-72c33d0b09ba":{"type":"text-and-image","disabled":true,"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chamonix_Skin_Care_Flowers.jpg","image_mask":"none","image2_mask":"none","subtitle":"","title":"Natural Advantages","text":"<p>Chamonix anti-wrinkle cream, under eye wrinkle cream, anti-aging hand cream and other anti-aging treatments contain a number of ingredients that are highly effective, and it’s no surprise, given that most have been used for thousands of years in cultures all over the world.
