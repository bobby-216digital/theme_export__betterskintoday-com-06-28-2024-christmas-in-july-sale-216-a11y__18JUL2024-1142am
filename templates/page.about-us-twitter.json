Like countless people before her, she had tried numerous skin care products promising to reduce the appearance of aging – everything from facial wrinkles to dark circles under the eyes – and countless people before her had always been disappointed.<\/p><p>George agreed to help. Drawing on his background in pharmaceuticals, chemistry and nutrition, he created a simple compound containing strong antioxidants and natural ingredients. To safely maximize absorption of the active ingredients, George used a base of calendula flower extract, a plant that has been used in natural healing for millennia.<\/p>","button_label":"USE CODE: CYBER50","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/highest-rated","button_style":"primary","align_text":"left","image_width":"50","layout":"right","divider":false,"top_padding":true,"bottom_padding":true,"lazyload_images":true}},"92660659-67c1-4df3-91de-72c33d0b09ba":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chamonix_Skin_Care_Flowers.jpg","image_mask":"none","image2_mask":"none","subtitle":"","title":"","text":"<p>The results were sensational. Word quickly spread among the customer’s friends and acquaintances, which were eager to try the miraculous antioxidant skin care product for themselves. Before long, George was filling order after order, mixing in his kitchen an anti-aging cream that, unlike numerous products already on the market, that actually worked.<\/p><p>A turning point came when a dermatologist saw the effects of the skin cream. Highly skeptical of commercial anti-aging treatments, the doctor was astounded by what Georges’ antioxidant skin care formula could do. George began making guest appearances on a variety of doctor’s radio shows until every doctor on radio was endorsing his anti-aging skin care product. The medical community at large took notice, and physicians across the country, including diet guru Dr. Atkins, whose wife was a customer, were endorsing this amazing new anti-aging cream.<\/p>","button_label":"USE CODE: CYBER50","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/highest-rated","button_style":"primary","align_text":"left","image_width":"50","layout":"left","divider":false,"top_padding":true,"bottom_padding":true,"lazyload_images":true}},"6521e305-0e0b-48b9-9953-a456c5d6cf13":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chamonix_Skin_Care_Jawline_Flowers.jpg","image_mask":"none","image2_mask":"none","subtitle":"","title":"","text":"<p>George quit his day job, and the Chamonix® line of antioxidant skin care products was born.<\/p><p>The Chamonix philosophy remains the same as the day George created his first anti-aging skin cream.
